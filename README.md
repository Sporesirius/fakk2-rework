Trying to modernize Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K. 2

NOTE: I don't have time for this project at the moment and it is not a high priority for me. Maybe there are people who want to work on it.
The features suggested here were just ideas.

### Planned Features (ideas):

- [] Switch to CMake
- [] Overall bug fixes and modernization of the code
- [] Porting F.A.K.K. 2 to [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) or [vkQuake3](https://github.com/suijingfeng/vkQuake3) for Vulkan support?
- [] Implementing netcode for F.A.K.K. 2 Arena and later [RetroSpy](https://github.com/GameProgressive/RetroSpyServer) services?
- [] Possibly adding NVIDIA RTX if we use vkQuake3 with the vulkan renderer?
